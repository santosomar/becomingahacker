# Becoming a Hacker O'Reilly & Pearson Training

This is the repository used for the [Becoming a Hacker](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/becoming-a-hacker/0636920140719/) O'Reilly & Pearson Training by [Omar Santos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/santosomar/).

## Description

[Becoming a Hacker](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/becoming-a-hacker/0636920140719/) is your first step to starting your ethical hacking and penetration testing career. This intensive two-day training session is taught by [Omar Santos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/santosomar/). This training includes focused live discussions, real-world demos, and insights into hacking from someone who’s been on the front lines. You will benefit from expert insights of the methodologies used to assess and compromise a network. You will also learn about the legal aspects of ethical hacking and the associated risks. This course additionally reviews many different tools that can be used to penetrate a wired and wireless network and the systems within that network.

### AI and Offensive Security
You will learn how to use AI to help you perform penetration testing and bug hunting. AI is changing the way we perform penetration testing and bug hunting. It is becoming more and more important to learn how to use AI to help you perform these tasks.

### Step-by-Step Guidance
No prior penetration testing or ethical hacking experience is needed. You will be introduced to offensive cybersecurity concepts and then walk through a complete penetration test, from beginning to end. You will explore passive and active reconnaissance, fuzzing, enumeration, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and post-exploitation techniques. 

This course is also helpful for those seeking certifications such as the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) Certification, CEH Practical, PenTest+, or the GIAC Penetration Tester (GPEN), this two-day training session is a great place to start. This live training can also help you if you want to start exploring the world of bug hunting and bug bounties.
