# An Overview of Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing Methodologies

## Introduction

Ethical hacking and penetration testing are critical components of modern cybersecurity. This module provides a comprehensive overview of the methodologies, frameworks, and best practices used by security professionals to identify and address vulnerabilities in systems and networks.

## What is Ethical Hacking?

Ethical hacking involves authorized attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems, applications, or data. The goal is to identify security weaknesses that malicious hackers could exploit. Ethical hackers use the same tools and techniques as malicious hackers but do so legally and with permission.

## Penetration Testing Methodologies

### Common Frameworks

- **OWASP Testing Guide**: Comprehensive framework for web application security testing
- **PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)**: Defines the standard for penetration testing
- **NIST SP 800-115**: Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment
- **OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)**: Scientific methodology for security testing

### Phases of Penetration Testing

1. **Planning and Reconnaissance**: Gather information about the target
2. **Scanning**: Identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities
3. **Gaining Access**: Exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access
4. **Maintaining Access**: Establish persistence in the compromised system
5. **Analysis and Reporting**: Document findings and provide remediation recommendations

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

- Always obtain written authorization before conducting penetration tests
- Understand the scope and boundaries of the engagement
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Maintain confidentiality of discovered vulnerabilities
- Comply with relevant laws and regulations (CFAA, GDPR, etc.)

## Key Concepts

- **White Box Testing**: Full knowledge of the target system
- **Black Box Testing**: No prior knowledge of the target system
- **Gray Box Testing**: Partial knowledge of the target system
- **Rules of Engagement (RoE)**: Defines the scope, limitations, and guidelines for testing

## Next Steps

After understanding the fundamentals, you'll learn how to build your own offensive security lab to practice these methodologies in a safe, controlled environment.
